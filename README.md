# Numerical-Analysis
A bunch of algorithms which I coded to better understand how the topics in my Numerical Analysis syllabus work and also restart my brain's logical faculty which had become too mushy from being depended on AI agents. 
Coded in Python.

This code is 100% human written.

Feel free to use these algorithms in your projects (if needed) or suggest modifications maybe?

So far there are algorithms for :

1. Interpolation : Newton's Forward, Backward for equal intervals, Newton's Divided Difference and Lagrange's interpolation for unequal intervals.
2. Finding the solution to a non-linear algebraic equation using bisection method, regula-falsi method and the newton-raphson method.
3. Finding the solution of an ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) using Euler's method for explicit equations and ODEs and the Runge-Kutta method for 2nd order Differential Equations
4. Finding the solution to a system of equations using matrices (Work-In-Progress)
5. Solving a definite integral using numerical analysis (Work-In-Progress)
